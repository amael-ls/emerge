# Project Emerge

## History
This project ran from 2008 to 2013 and aimed to develop new allometric functions for above-ground tree volume and taper volume.

It was initiated by Christine Deleuze (Office National des ForÃªts).

Unfortunately, not all the objectives of this project were fulfilled. Today, we try to overcome the difficulties encountered during the project and to finally derive a coherent model for different type of volumes.
