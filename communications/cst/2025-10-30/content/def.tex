\chapter{Definitions and datasets\label{chap::def}}

Trees are partitioned into hierarchical elements with definitions that may vary between Forest Inventories and datasets (\eg Fig. \ref{fig::partition}).

\end{figure*}

In our case, the tree data come from different institutes, different periods of time, and do not all have the same tree components recorded:

\end{marginfigure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item `Protocole Oudin', dataset preserved by INRAE, ranging from 1930 to 1980 (in red on Fig. \ref{fig::map}). Recorded the bole volume, and the large and small branches. Hereafter, we name this dataset `Emerge', which was the name of the project that digitalised this dataset in 2008 \parencite{Deleuze2013}.
	\item The French \NFI (in blue on the Fig. \ref{fig::map}). Data range from 1988 to 2007 (data before 1988 record diameter rather than circumference). Recorded the bole volume.
	\item Experimental Forest Management project dataset \parencite[in yello on Fig. \ref{fig::map}]{Didion2024}. Data range from 1888 to 1974, and bole volume, large branches, and small branches were recorded.
	\item The `Office National des Forêts (ONF)', with protocols from 1972 and from 1983 (not used as there is no coordinates)
	\item Institut Technologique Forêt, Cellulose, Bois-construction, Ameublement (FCBA), not used so far for the aerial volume
	\item L'Institut pour le développement forestier (IDF) which is the R\&D of the Centre National de la Propriété Forestière and the Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l'environnement et l'agriculture (IRSTEA, currently INRAE)
\end{enumerate}

We decided to use the definitions from \cite{Gschwantner2009} (see Figs. \ref{fig::partition} and \ref{fig::ign_tree}):

\begin{marginfigure}%
	\input{Figures/tree.tex}
	\caption{Scheme of tree components.\label{fig::ign_tree}}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Main stem: The stem of a tree is the above-ground part of the main (off) shoot with apical dominance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stem top: topmost part of the stem from an over-bark base-diameter of \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI) to the stem tip
		\item Bole: above-ground part of the stem between stump and the stem top
		\item Stump: above-ground base part of the stem which would remain after a tree was cut under normal felling practices
	\end{itemize}
	\item Lateral parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Large branches: portion of the above-ground lateral parts with a diameter of more than or equal to \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI)
		\item Large branches: portion of the above-ground lateral parts with a diameter of less than \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A total of \num{594616} individuals were measured, with 98\% coming from the \NFI{} (bole volume only), 6\% from the Swiss dataset (bole, large and small branches), and 2\% from Emerge (same components as the Swiss dataset; see Fig. \ref{fig::compo}). The difficulties in fitting the data are twofold: first, the data show high heteroskedasticity (see Fig \ref{fig::fagSyl}), and second, the datasets are unbalanced.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Figures/resp_fagus.pdf}
	\caption{Typical response of bole volume to circumference (here displayed for \textit{Fagus sylvatica}). We can see that both the Emerge and Swiss datasets \parencite{Deleuze2013,Didion2024} are quite similar and covers elongated trees, while the French \NFI{} covers less regular trees. \label{fig::fagSyl}}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, title = Bole volume (volume bois-fort tige)]
	The bole volume is the `reference' volume since the creation of the French \NFI{} (1958). Its definition is largely driven by the requirements of the wood industry, for which the estimation of standing timber volume is an essential tool for resource management and planning.
