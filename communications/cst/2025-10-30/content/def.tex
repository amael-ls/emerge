\chapter{Definitions and datasets\label{chap::def}}

Trees are partitioned into hierarchical elements with definitions that may vary between Forest Inventories and datasets (\eg Fig. \ref{fig::partition}).

\end{figure*}

In our case, the tree data were collected from several institutions, at different periods, and with varying levels of detail regarding recorded tree components:

\end{marginfigure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item `Protocole Oudin' dataset -- Preserved by INRAE and covering the period 1930--1980 (shown in red in Fig. \ref{fig::map}). This dataset includes measurements of bole volume, large branches, and small branches. Hereafter, it is referred to as `Emerge', after the 2008 digitisation project of the same name \parencite{Deleuze2013}.
	\item Experimental Forest Management Project dataset (EFM) -- Described by Didion et al. (2024) and covering the period 1888--1974 (shown in yellow in Fig. \ref{fig::map}). It includes measurements of bole volume, large branches, and small branches.
	\item French National Forest Inventory (\NFI) -- Data collected between 1988 and 2007 (shown in blue in Fig. \ref{fig::map}). Earlier data (before 1988) recorded diameter instead of circumference and are discarded in this study. This dataset contains measurements of bole volume, following the \NFI{} protocol (less detailed than Emerge and EFM).
	\item `Office National des Forêts (ONF)' -- Data collected with protocols from 1972 and from 1983. So far, these data are not used due to the absence of geographic coordinates.
	\item Institut Technologique Forêt, Cellulose, Bois-construction, Ameublement (FCBA) -- Data available but not yet used for aerial volume estimation.
	\item Institut pour le Développement Forestier (IDF) -- The R\&D branch of the Centre National de la Propriété Forestière (CNPF) and the Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies pour l'Environnement et l'Agriculture (IRSTEA, now INRAE). Data not used.
\end{enumerate}

The terminology follows that of \cite{Gschwantner2009} (see Figs. \ref{fig::partition} and \ref{fig::ign_tree}) to ensure consistency in wording across the different datasets:

\begin{marginfigure}%
	\input{Figures/tree.tex}
	\caption{Scheme of tree components.\label{fig::ign_tree}}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Main stem: The stem of a tree is the above-ground part of the main (off) shoot with apical dominance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stem top: topmost part of the stem from an over-bark base-diameter of \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI) to the stem tip
		\item Bole: above-ground part of the stem between stump and the stem top
		\item Stump: above-ground base part of the stem which would remain after a tree was cut under normal felling practices
	\end{itemize}
	\item Lateral parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Large branches: portion of the above-ground lateral parts with a diameter of more than or equal to \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI)
		\item Large branches: portion of the above-ground lateral parts with a diameter of less than \qty{7}{\centi\metre} (French \NFI)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The combination of the Emerge, EFM, and \NFI{} datasets provides a total of \num{594616} individuals, with 98\% coming from the \NFI{} (bole volume only), 6\% from the EFM (bole, large and small branches), and 2\% from Emerge (same components as EFM; see Fig. \ref{fig::compo}). The challenges in fitting the data are threefold: (\textit{i}) the data exhibit strong heteroskedasticity (see Fig. \ref{fig::fagSyl}); (\textit{ii}) the datasets are unbalanced; and (\textit{iii}) the trees from the Emerge and EFM datasets do not provide exhaustive forest coverage, implying that total volume estimates for the \NFI{} are often based on extrapolation.

We can see that both the Emerge and Swiss datasets \parencite{Deleuze2013,Didion2024} are quite similar and covers elongated trees, while the French \NFI{} covers less regular trees. \label{fig::fagSyl}}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, title = Bole volume (volume bois-fort tige)]
	The bole volume is the `reference' volume since the creation of the French \NFI{} (1958). Its definition is largely driven by the requirements of the wood industry, for which the estimation of standing timber volume is an essential tool for resource management and planning.
