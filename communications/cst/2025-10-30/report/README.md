# Report for the Conseil Scientifique et Technique of IGN, 30.10.2025

This document was written as a synthesis for the Conseil Scientifique et Technique (CST) on three topics:

- Allometric equation on bole volume (Florence Gohon, FG)
- Allometric equation on total volume (Amaël Le Squin, ALS)
- Wood density (Henri Cunny, HC)

After a discussion held on 12.12.2025, with Daniel Bonnery, Stéphanie Wurpillot, Manuel Fulchiron, FG, HC, and ALS it was decided that this document will serve as the basis for the next round of CST revisions on the bole volume allometries.
