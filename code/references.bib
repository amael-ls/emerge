It refers to the stem volume of individual trees which is typically derived by models as it cannot be easily measured directly. These models are thus based on measurable tree dimensions and their parameterization depends on the available empirical data. Historically, such data were collected by measurements of tree stem sizes, which is very time- and cost-intensive. Here, we present an exceptionally large dataset with section-wise stem measurements on 40'349 felled individual trees collected on plots of the Experimental Forest Management project. It is a revised and expanded version of previously unpublished data and contains the empirically derived coarse (diameter ≥7 cm) and fine branch volume of 27'297 and 18'980, respectively, individual trees. The data were collected between 1888 and 1974 across Switzerland covering a large topographic gradient and a diverse species range and can thus support estimations and verification of volume functions also outside Switzerland including the derivation of whole tree volume in a consistent manner.},

Because the cumulative bole volume of each tree is measured to numerous upper-bole locations, correlations between measurements within a tree are likely. A mixed-effects model is fitted to account for this within-subject (tree) correlation structure, while also portraying the sigmoidal shape of the cumulative bole volume profile.},

	title = {Common tree definitions for national forest inventories in Europe},
	volume = {43},
	DOI = {10.14214/sf.463},
	abstractNote = {At the international level, various definitions have been established for the compilation and publication of forest resources assessment results over the last decade. These international definitions frequently rely on terms that are not precisely specified for inventory purposes and do not completely cover the requirements arising from the application of National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Also, with respect to conventional topics such as forest area and growing stock estimation, several terms and expressions referring to individual trees are not, or are only vaguely, defined until now. Since the individual tree is the basic element of any forest resources assessment, the clarification of tree-related terms is an important part of COST Action E43 to harmonise common reporting of National Forest Inventories. Based on a review of existing definitions and on the requirements for harmonised reporting, common tree-related definitions are established. One objective of this study is to refine and enhance the applicability of available tree and shrub definitions, in particular with regard to the distinction between trees and shrubs. The study also focuses on the parts or âelementsâ of trees and on the distinction between these elements as they are of particular importance in growing stock and biomass definitions. Furthermore, several definitions for tree characteristics such as âlivingâ and âstandingâ, as well as tree variables such as height, length, diameter at breast height, and crown projection area are adjusted with respect to NFI purposes. A concluding discussion reflects upon the reviewed, refined and newly established definitions. The definitions presented in this paper provide a firm basis for a common set of harmonised reference definitions developed by COST Action E43 and contribute to the precise and consistent use of terms.},

	abstractNote = {The objective of this study was to model the volume expansion factor (VEF), defined as being the ratio between the total aboveground woody volume and the stem merchantable volume of a tree, as a function of tree height and diameter at breast height.A large database (dataset #1) of detailed stem and branches volume measurements, constituted by 8192 felled trees from 19 temperate tree species, was used for calibrating the models. In addition, an independent dataset (dataset #2), constituted by 176 felled trees from 13 species, was collected for validating the models.From dataset #1, the RMSE for the prediction of the total volume varied from 0.005 to 0.476m3, depending on the diameter class, and the corresponding relative RMSE varied from 8.0% to 13.7%, depending on the diameter class.A 10-fold cross-validation on dataset #1 gave an average RMSE of 0.136 for the prediction of the VEF and of 0.150m3 for the prediction of the total volume, which was in the same order as average RMSE obtained from the whole dataset #1.Validation on dataset #2 gave satisfactory results, even for the application of VEF to other tree species: RMSE obtained for the different tree species were in the same order as RMSE obtained from calibration dataset #1, except for some particular cases. The largest errors were obtained when the model was clearly used in extrapolation, e.g., for five large-size Fraxinus (whereas dataset #1 included smaller trees) and several Quercus and Fagus from coppice-with-standards stands (whereas dataset #1 included mainly pure even-aged high-forest trees).The observed differences between species seemed consistent with the general knowledge about species-specific traits. For a given diameter at breast height, angiosperms were found to have a much larger volume of branches in comparison with the corresponding stem volume than gymnosperms. For a tree of 30cm in diameter, the lowest values of VEF were obtained for Picea and Abies (VEF<1.1) and the highest ones for Fraxinus and Carpinus (VEF>1.3).The methodology that was developed, based on nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, is easily applicable to other definitions of VEF or biomass expansion factors.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

The method is also shown to be applicable for approximating the sum of lognormal-Rice and Suzuki RVs by a single lognormal RV. A sum consisting of a mixture of the above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation and does so without the extremely precise numerical computations at a large number of points that were required by the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the lognormal sum distribution. The accuracy of the method is measured both visually, as has been done in the literature, as well as quantitatively, using curve-fitting metrics. An upper bound on the sensitivity of the method is also provided.},

	abstractNote = {Allometric scaling laws critically examine structure-function relationships. In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially large ones, and has not yet been solved in either theory or practice. Here, we propose the concept of a dynamic allometric scaling relationship between stem biomass and above-ground biomass The allometric curve approaches an asymptote with an increase in tree size. An asymptotic allometric equation is presented that has a better fit to the data than the simple power-law allometric equation. The non-constant exponent is determined by the change in the biomass ratio for different organs and is governed by the dynamic allometric coefficient. This study presents a methodological framework to theoretically characterize allometric relationships and provides new insights in understanding the general scaling pattern and carbon sequestration capacity of large trees across global forests. Projecting biomass carbon in forests is challenging due to the modelling of different-sized trees. This Article proposes a dynamic allometric scaling relationship that better fits scaling patterns for large trees and their biomass.},

The analysis indicated that most of the biomass equations were developed for aboveground tree components. A relatively small number of equations were developed for southern Europe. Most of the biomass equations were based on a few sampled sites with a very limited number of sampled trees. The volume equations were, in general, based on more representative data covering larger geographical regions. The volume equations were available for major tree species in Europe.
